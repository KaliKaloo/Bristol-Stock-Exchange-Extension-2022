# IEFT-Coursework
In this coursework I design and execute a set of experiments on BSE (Bristol Stock Exchange) that evaluate PRDE, 
to gain some understanding of how the choice of k and F affects its behavior.
Then I improve upon PRDE either by editing/extending PRDE, or by using some other form of adaptive algorithm.
